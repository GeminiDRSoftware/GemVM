# GemVM

A simple command-line control interface to help users run a virtual machine
on their local computer with QEMU. In particular, this allows execution of
Intel Linux binaries on recent ARM64 MacOS hosts, in order to make IRAF
available there.

The code repository can be found at https://github.com/GeminiDRSoftware/GemVM.
